# GMC-Bind
A new method used for Enhancing RNA-Protein Binding Prediction via Cross-Attentional Fusion of Multi-Scale Sequence and Graph Structural Features

# Dependency
Pytorch 2.4.0
python >=3.8, <3.13

# Dataset
Download the trainig and testing data from http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/GraphProt/GraphProt_CLIP_sequences.tar.bz2 and decompress it in current dir.
It has 24 experiments of 21 RBPs, and we need train one model per experiment.
